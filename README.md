Learning Music Ableton is a useful tool for people that want to learn how to make electronic music starting from the basics. This sites breaks down and shows you all the components of electronic music, so you can hear, see, and interact with it on a micro level. Ableton is a great website if you prefer interactive learning online for free.

## Purpose

We will be performing a usability test for Ableton. The purpose of usability test is to improve the usability of the site by observing and testing the users and gathering feedback. We want to see how easy or hard it is for participants to use the site and the practicality of learning electronic music as a beginner. 

A usability test helps us identify particular problems by observing and testing the participant and recieving their feedback; where as, a heuristic test points out the overall problems with the website set by a guideline. A usability test is more effective in understanding people's behaviors and thoughts.


## Methodology
For my usability test, I performed it on campus at UCLA using my personal laptop. I used screen recording on my laptop to record my usability test as well as my iphone to record the participants facial expressions. 

For Music Learning Ableton, the usability issues I found in my heuristic review were:

Visibility of System Status: There is not a section where you can switch inbetween individual sections. If you wanted to look at a previous section, you would have to press "previous" multiple times

Match Between System and the Real World: There are terms not familiar to users that flow in a natural order

Consistency and Standards: Users can get lost inbtween all of the pages they are clicking through because there is not a page at the bottom they can easily switch through

I used the hueristics evaluation to guide and determine which questions to ask for the usability testing survey.


#### Process of Usability Test: 
* Introduction
* Informed Consent
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* Task Scenarios
* Post-Test Questionnaire
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

# Reflection

The UT went pretty well. Something I will keep in mind next time is the environment we were in. We were in a secluded outdoors area, but there were some interuptions from people passing by in front of us and noise pollution from the area surrounding us. Another note that I think is worth mentioning is that my particpant was not very vocal and didn't need much help navigating the site or answering the survey questions. Being recorded felt a little awkward for the participant, but once she found out how calm it was, she became accustomed to the camera.

The usabilty test was helpful for me to see how easy or hard it was for the participant to navigate the site. It gave me insight about what ws wrong with the site as well as the problems with the survey itself. There was one part of the survey that could have been more clear, but the participant was able to figure it out after spending some time navigating the site. The participant thought the website was creative. trustworthy, professional, and familiar. It was very easy for her to complete the tasks. In the post-test questionaire the participant, thought the survey was very easy and straighforward.


I couldn't find a man close to my target audience, but I had Angela particpate in my study. Although she is not the target demographic, it gives insight to the overall usefulness of the website. For future surveys, I will test middle-aged men. Overall, I could try to have a better conversation with my particpant, so to encourage her to be more vocal and talkative does the usability testing.
